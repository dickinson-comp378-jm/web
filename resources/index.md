# Detailed schedule




## Class 1

* Overview of the course. 
* Discussion of: why do we need databases?
* Instructions on XAMPP installation:
  - The recommended database software for this course is the XAMPP
    package. This can be downloaded and installed on Windows, Linux,
    and MacOS from the [XAMPP web
    page](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) at
    apachefriends.org.
  - If desired, you can use the iMacs in Tome with XAMPP. You will
    need to create a virtual machine on one of the iMacs then use
    XAMPP within that virtual machine. A virtual machine image is
    provided to help you with this. Details:
	  * under construction...
