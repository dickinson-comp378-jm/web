# Detailed schedule

## Class 27

* Informal discussion of NoSQL databases (Ch 11 of PDBM), based on

## Class 26

Meet at the HUB Social Hall for the Civic Engagement poster session,
1:30pm. Browse posters (especially computer science senior seminar
projects) until 2 PM, then return to Tome for regular class (database
security demo).

Database security demo (demonstrates a security flaw known as [SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection)):
* visit [http://localhost/bank.php](http://localhost/bank.php), put any amount into the 'Amount to deposit' box, and this exact string into the 'Account number' box: `111' or 'xyz'='xyz`
  - what happened and why?
* install the files [bank-insecure.php](../php/bank-insecure.php) and [depositMoney-insecure.php](../php/depositMoney-insecure.php) into `xampp/htdocs`
* visit [http://localhost/bank-insecure.php](http://localhost/bank-insecure.php), put any amount into the 'Amount to deposit' box, and this exact string into the 'Account number' box: `111; drop table accounts;`
  - what happened and why?


## Class 25

In-class activities:
  1. Quick overview of relevant slides from textbook materials: slides
     30-40 from [Chapter 15 Database

## Class 12

The take-home exam begins at the start of class today. Please contact
the instructor via email or Teams with any questions.



## Class 11

Exam review notes: [exam-review.pptx](class11/exam-review.pptx)

## Class 10

Main topic for today: defining indexes and views.

Most of the class session will be devoted to a lab on these topics: [views-and-indexes-lab.docx](class10/views-and-indexes-lab.docx)

The lab requires use of the [Southwind](../sql/southwind.sql) database.

## Class 9

Main topic for today: SQL statements `exists`, `union`, `intersect`, `except`, `insert into`, `delete from`, `update`, `alter table`

Notes: 
1. `intersect` and `except` are not available in MySQL. You should be
   aware of these but we will not use them.
1. `insert`, `delete`, and `update` are good examples of
   transactions. By default, in MySQL, any single statement will be
   treated as a transaction.
1. This is a good time to start using the Format button in
   phpMyAdmin. It will make your SQL much easier to read.
1. It's also a good time to start commenting your SQL code. Lines
   beginning with two dashes (`--`) are treated as comments.

The class will consist of some demos of the above SQL statements
followed by free lab time for working on homework assignments and
asking questions.




## Class 8

Main topic for today: database joins
* Whiteboard notes: [08-joins-whiteboard.svg](class08/08-joins-whiteboard.svg)
* Example databases: 
  - [CarlisleMenuItems.sql](../sql/CarlisleMenuItems.sql)
  - [CarlisleMenuItemB.sql](../sql/CarlisleMenuItemsB.sql)


## Class 7

Most of this class will be devoted to an ungraded but required lab
activity to learn about creating and altering database tables within
phpMyAdmin:
* [table-creation-lab.docx](class07/table-creation-lab.docx)

If you don't have access to XAMPP, a great way to practice with
phpMyAdmin is to use the online demo server at
[phpmyadmin.net](https://demo.phpmyadmin.net/master-config/). Note
that this is a public server so your work can be viewed, altered, or
deleted by others.

## Class 6

Warmup exercise for functional dependencies and normalization: 
* [review-func-dep.xlsx](class06/review-func-dep.xlsx)
* corresponding database: [carlislefood.sql](class06/carlislefood.sql)

Main topic for today: converting ER model to relational model.
* [textbook slides for chapter 6](https://www.pdbmbook.com/vault/Chapter%20Relational%20Databases.pdf/access) again; we go over slides 49-62 and 74-77 in class.

## Class 5

Please take the [quiz on relations and
keys](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=VbAyYrl2E0ybiLVirn22-2zFL4dI9oNMmoALudp-AK9UNEgyODZYVVpVNVNCS1BKODNVQ0I5Q0JPVS4u).
(Does not affect your grade, but demonstrates your understanding.)

[relation-overview.svg](class03/relation-overview.svg)

Main topic for today: the EER model (_enhanced_ ER model).
* We continue with [textbook slides for chapter

  - Note the methodology on slide 45. This will be useful for
    homework.


## Class 2

Key concepts from chapters 1 and 2:
* *transaction*: see textbook section 1.5.6
* *ACID* properties of transactions: see textbook section 1.5.6
* Different types of database management systems (DBMS): hierarchical,
  network, relational, object-oriented, XML, no-SQL. See textbook
  section 2.2.1. In this course, we focus almost exclusively on the
  relational approach, which is dominant in practice.
  
Main topic for today: the ER model.
* See [textbook slides for chapter 3](https://www.pdbmbook.com/vault/Chapter%20Conceptual%20Data%20Modeling%20using%20EER%20and%20UML.pdf/access).

SQL topics: select, from, distinct, as, where, and, between, in, like, is null. See 7.3.1.1.



## Class 1

* Overview of the course. 
* Discussion of: why do we need databases?
* Instructions on XAMPP installation:
  - The recommended database software for this course is the XAMPP
    package. This can be downloaded and installed on Windows, Linux,
    and MacOS from the [XAMPP web
    page](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) at
    apachefriends.org.
  - If desired, you can use the iMacs in Tome with XAMPP. You will
    need to create a virtual machine on one of the iMacs then use
    XAMPP within that virtual machine. A virtual machine image is
    provided to help you with this. Details:
	  * Download the VM image file, [comp378VM.ova](https://dickinson0-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/jmac_dickinson_edu/EQSsBh04sspDoldjO7RoU6sBZ5k0QlMb444-a0REQrPdXA?e=JTfYUd)
	  * Open the VirtualBox app, then choose File &#124; Import Appliance and pick `comp378VM.ova`
	  * The [username and password for this virtual
        machine](https://lms.dickinson.edu/mod/page/view.php?id=1080082)
        are available on Moodle.
* accessing phpMyAdmin:
  - on Windows
    - Run XAMPP control panel as administrator
    - Start Apache and MySQL
    - Click on Admin for MySQL
  - on Ubuntu
    - open Terminal, enter `sudo /opt/lampp/manager-linux-x64.run`
    - on Manage Servers tab, choose Start All
    - open FireFox, visit http://localhost, click on phpMyAdmin (top right)
* importing the `wine` database:
  - download [wine.sql](../sql/wine.sql)
  - in phpMyAdmin:
    * click the Home icon, then New
	* enter `wine` as database name, click Create
	* click Import &#124; Choose File, then select `wine.sql`
	* click Go (bottom right)
* querying the `wine` database (Do this in your own phpMyAdmin or at
  the [textbook online playground](https://www.pdbmbook.com/playground)):
  - click on SQL
  - enter `SELECT * FROM supplier`, click Go (bottom right)
  - for a more interesting example, try `SELECT * FROM supplier WHERE supcity='San Francisco'`

* [chapter 1 textbook slides](https://www.pdbmbook.com/vault/Chapter%20Fundamental%20Concepts%20of%20Database%20Management.pdf/access): especially slides 4-13, 17-18, 21
