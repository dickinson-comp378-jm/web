# QRA (Quantitative Reasoning Associate)

We are fortunate to have a QRA working with us this semester. Our QRA
is Percy Pham (phamph@dickinson.edu). Percy will be holding
office hours on an as-needed basis to help with understanding of class material and homework assignments. Please email him to arrange an appointment.
