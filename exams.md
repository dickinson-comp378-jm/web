# Exams

Under construction.

<!-- As stated on the syllabus: -->
    
<!-- > The midterm and final exams are open note and open web. Students may -->
<!-- > consult any printed or digital materials and may perform web -->
<!-- > searches. However, no communication with other humans is permitted.   -->
<!-- > ...   -->
<!-- > Technically speaking, any material covered in any lecture, reading, -->
<!-- > or homework assignment is eligible to appear in the midterm or final -->
<!-- > exams. In practice, a strong majority of exam questions will be -->
<!-- > similar to a homework question, an example done in class, or other -->
<!-- > assigned practice questions. -->

<!-- Following is some additional clarification of the above syllabus -->
<!-- statements. Students are encouraged to use all appropriate tools, -->
<!-- including Eclipse, web searches, and existing content on programming -->
<!-- websites and forums. However, it is not permitted to seek help from -->
<!-- other humans either directly or via an online forum. -->

<!-- Exams will be provided in Microsoft Word format. -->

<!-- Exam solutions should be submitted to GitHub using the same -->
<!-- methodology as for homework assignments: answers that involve writing -->
<!-- source code are pushed to the relevant Java files in GitHub; non-code -->
<!-- answers are inserted into a PDF document which is pushed to the -->
<!-- `noncode-answers` directory in GitHub. Non-code answers may include -->
<!-- handwritten solutions that have been scanned or photographed. -->

<!-- Students with academic accommodations receive extra time in the -->
<!-- normal way. For example, if the stated time to submit the exam is 24 -->
<!-- hours, a student who normally receives time-and-a-half for tests will -->
<!-- have 36 hours to complete the exam. -->
