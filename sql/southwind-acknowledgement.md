The Southwind database was originally provided by Microsoft as a
Microsoft Access 2010 sample database called Northwind. The version
provided here is a port to MySQL by Dale Scott, obtained from

Files were downloaded by John MacCormick in December 2021 and lightly
edited. The entire database was renamed to Southwind to avoid
confusion with the original Northwind version.
